## Background
With the development of Large Language Model (LLMs), their underlying network structure, the Transformer, is being extensively studied. Researching the Transformer structure helps us enhance our understanding of this "black box" and improve model interpretability. Recently, there has been an increasing body of work suggesting that the model contains two distinct partitions: attention mechanisms used for behavior, inference, and analysis, and Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) for knowledge storage. The former is crucial for revealing the functional capabilities of the model, leading to a series of studies exploring various functions within attention mechanisms, which we have termed **Attention Head Mining**.

## About Our Survey
In this survey, we delve into the potential mechanisms of how attention heads in LLMs contribute to the reasoning process.
