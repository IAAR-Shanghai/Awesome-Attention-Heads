# Awesome-Attention-Heads

With the development of large language models, their underlying network structure, the Transformer, is being extensively studied. Researching the Transformer structure helps us enhance our understanding of this "black box" and improve model interpretability. Recently, there has been an increasing body of work suggesting that the model contains two distinct partitions: attention mechanisms used for behavior, inference, and analysis, and feed-forward networks (FNN) for knowledge storage. The former is crucial for revealing the functional capabilities of the model, leading to a series of studies exploring various functions within attention mechanisms.
